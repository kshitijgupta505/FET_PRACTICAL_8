# FET_PRACTICAL_8
Objective: To understand the usage of promises in EcmaScript.

Exercise:
My friend Kayo promises to make a cake for my birthday in two weeks.

If everything goes well and Kayo doesn't get sick, we'll have a certain number of cakes**. Otherwise, if Kayo gets sick, we'll have no cakes.

Either way, we're still going to have a party.

For this first task, we'll translate this story into code using Promise concept of EcmaScript.

Note : (**You can ask Kayo on runtime if she is healthy or not and the number of cakes she can bake.)
